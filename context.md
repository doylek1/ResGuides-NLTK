# Context

Nltk is a library of Python for nlp. 

The NLTK project began when Steven Bird was teaching Computation Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania in 2001, and hired his star student, Edward Loper, from the previous offering of the course to be the teaching assistant (TA). 

They agreed a plan for developing software infrastructure for NLP teaching that could be easily maintained over time. 

That software infrastructure became nltk.

There are 32 universities in the US and 25 countries using NLTK in their courses. 

NLTK supports at least 40 different languages.

So it's designed by researchers for researchers, although many others use it. 

NLTK is open source, so anyone with the skills can contribute to the tool. 

NLTK was written by computational linguists. In fact, Steven Bird is now a professor here at Melb uni. 

The advantage to this is that there is a whole literature of functional linguistics behind the nltk, to justify your choice of methods.

According to scopus, Natural Language Processing with Python has been cited 461 times, since published in 2009, in research that really covers the gamut of disciplines from Computer Science, Social Sciences, Engineering, Mathematics, Arts and Humanities, Medicine, Business, Management and Accounting, Decision Sciences, Neuroscience, Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology
