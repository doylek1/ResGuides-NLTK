# The Natural Language Toolkit

As I mentioned in the introduction, NLTK is a library of Python for NLP. NLTK is [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) and anyone with the skills can contribute to the tool. 

It began its life in 2001 as a project of Steven Bird and Edward Loper. At the time, Bird was a professor in computational linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania and Loper, his star student. Together they agreed a plan for developing software infrastructure for NLP teaching that could be easily maintained over time. 

That software infrastructure became NLTK. The toolkit supports at least 40 different languages and is now used in university courses around the world.  It is also backed by the theoretical framework and literature of functional linguistics.

*Functional linguistics* is a research area concerned with how *realized language* (lexis and grammar) work to achieve meaningful social functions.

One functional linguistic theory is *Systemic Functional Linguistics*, developed by Michael Halliday (Prof. Emeritus at University of Sydney).

Central to the theory is a division between **experiential meanings** and **interpersonal meanings**.

* Experiential meanings communicate what happened to whom, under what circumstances.
* Interpersonal meanings negotiate identities and role relationships between speakers 

Halliday argues that these two kinds of meaning are realized **simultaneously** through different parts of English grammar.

* Experiential meanings made through **transitivity choices**.
* Interpersonal meanings made through **mood choices**

Transitivity choices combine configurations of:

* Participants (*a man, green bikes*)
* Processes (*sleep, has always been, is considering*)
* Circumstances (*on the weekend*, *in Australia*)

Mood features of a language include:

* Mood types (*declarative, interrogative, imperative*)
* Modality (*would, can, might*)
* Lexical density--the number of words per clause, the number of content to non-content words, etc.

The book *Natural Language Processing with Python* (2009) written by Steven Bird, Edward Loper and their collaborator Ewan Klein, has been cited at least 461 times. This research covers the gamut of disciplines, from computer science to the social sciences, engineering, mathematics, medicine, biochemistry and genetics to business, management and accounting, to name only a few. 

Its design and use shows that NLTK is a tool designed by researchers for researchers, although it is now also used by industries and others
