# Context

As I mentioned in the introduction, NLTK is a library of Python for NLP. 

It began its life in 2001, as a project of Steven Bird and Edward Loper. Bird, a professor in computational linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania at the time and Loper, his star student. Together, they agreed a plan for developing software infrastructure for NLP teaching that could be easily maintained over time. That software infrastructure became NLTK, which is now used in many university courses, not just in the United States, but around the world. NLTK supports at least 40 different languages.

So it's designed by researchers for researchers, although many others use it. 

NLTK is open source, so anyone with the skills can contribute to the tool. 

NLTK was written by computational linguists. In fact, Steven Bird is now a professor here at Melb uni. 

The advantage to this is that there is a whole literature of functional linguistics behind the nltk, to justify your choice of methods.

According to scopus, Natural Language Processing with Python has been cited 461 times, since published in 2009, in research that really covers the gamut of disciplines from Computer Science, Social Sciences, Engineering, Mathematics, Arts and Humanities, Medicine, Business, Management and Accounting, Decision Sciences, Neuroscience, Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology
