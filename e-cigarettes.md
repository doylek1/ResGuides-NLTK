# E-cigarettes: extracting natural language place descriptions

> Using Twitter Data to Gain Insights into E-cigarette Marketing and Locations of Use: An Infoveillance Study \(Kim et al. 2015\)

This research, published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research, investigates the marketing of electronic cigarettes \(e-cigarettes\) via social media through a linguistic analysis of Twitter data.

Use of electronic cigarettes has increased exponentially in recent years. This trend is in part fueled by marketing and word-of-mouth communication on social media platforms like Twitter.

This study examines Twitter posts about e-cigarettes between the years 2008-2013 to gain insights into marketing trends in promoting and selling e-cigarettes and the locations where people use these devices.

Interestingly, this study uses a combination of manual classification and natural language processing to extract prepositional phrases, such as 'in', 'at' or 'of', to determine the locations where people use, or observe others using, e-cigarettes.

To prepare the corpus to extract these phrases, they use the NLTK parts-of-speech tagger to label each word in a tweet with its part of speech.

The authors confirmed an exponential increase in the volume of tweets on the subject of e-cigarettes, which is consistent with the increased expenditure on e-cigarette marketing and increased use among youths and adults. They also found that the vast majority of tweets \(93.43%\) were advertising the devices, as opposed to only 6.57% classed as non-advertisements. The ease of posting content to social media sites suggests that Twitter users may be more exposed to e-cigarette brands and vendors than non-Twitter users.

Interestingly, this study also found posts about e-cigarettes being used in public spaces. Some of the tweets indicated that students and staff were using the devices in class, although the majority of tweets were from non-users who were confused as to whether the use of e-cigarettes in public was allowed. Importantly, the study shows that youth and young adults are exposed to e-cigarette marketing in their everyday lives and the inaction of staff may give young people the idea that e-cigarettes are not as harmful as traditional cigarettes. This is a concern for public health professionals and has consequences for local governments if they introduce policies banning the use of these devices in public places.
