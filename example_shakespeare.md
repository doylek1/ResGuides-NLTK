> A Naive Bayes classifier for Shakespeareâ€™s second-person pronoun (Mahowald 2012)


Mahowald's research sits between historical English, computer science, psycho-linguistics and brain and cognitive sciences. 

His 2012 study investigates the way that *y-* and *th-* pronouns alternate in the full corpus of 37 Shakespearean plays. For *y-* pronouns think; 'you', 'your' etc... And ye olde; 'thee', 'thine', 'thou' etc... for *th-* pronouns. 

Mahoward uses NLTK to write a '[Naive Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier)' classifer. This statistical formula for probability considers each occurrence of a second-person pronoun as a 'black box' to be resolved into a *y-* or *th-* pronoun depending on the surrounding words. The ability  to  discriminate  between  forms  based  only  on  context is a form of collocational analysis, which we will dabble with in the activity ahead. In the case of this study, collocational analysis confirms the hypothesis that the second-person pronouns are used distinctly in the Shakespearean corpus.   

Significantly,  the  words  most  useful  in  classifying  a  pronoun  as  *y-* pronouns include high-register words such as lordship, madam, lords, and sir. After a group of conjugated second-person verbs, like 'didst' and 'hast', the words most associated with *th-* pronouns are  words such as torment, nuncle (a hilarious word for uncle), lesser,  and villain.

If you have any French, you will be interested to know that these pronouns are used similarly to *Tu* and *Vous*. *Y-* for formal situations or when an inferior is addressing a 'social better' and *th-* when addressing a servant, peer or other familiar persons.
