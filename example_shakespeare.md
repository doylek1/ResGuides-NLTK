# Example: Shakespeare

This study investigates the way that 'y-' and 'th-' pronouns alternate in the full corpus of 37 Shakespearean plays. For 'y' pronouns think; 'you', 'your' etc... And ye olde; 'thee', 'thine', 'thou' etc... for 'th' pronouns.

Significantly,  the  words  most  useful  in  classifying  a  pronoun  as  y-pronouns include high-register words such as lordship, madam, lords, and sir. 

After a group of conjugated second-person verbs like 'art' and 'wert', the words most associated with 'th-' pronouns  are  words such as torment, nuncle (?), lesser,  and villain.

The ability  to  discriminate  between  forms  based  only  on  context or collocational analysis, confirms  the  hypothesis that the two classes of second-person pronoun are used distinctly in the Shakespearean corpus. 

And that these pronouns are use similarly to *Tu* and *Vous* in French. 'Th-' for familiar and 'y-' for formal. The analysis also seems to suggest that these pronouns were used, at least in Shakespeare, in a similarly classist fashion. 'Th-' for addressing servants and 'y-' for nobility.

This is a form of collocational analysis, as I mentioned and will be using collocations in our challenge.
