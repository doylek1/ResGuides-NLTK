# Gender imbalance: the power of concordancing

Now that you have all concordanced and used collocations, here is an example of the kind of research you can conduct using NLP.

> ‘He’ vs ‘she’ in Australian media coverage: what the language of news tells us about gender imbalance \(Lukin 2016\)

Annabel Lukin used a corpus of 18 Australian newspapers over a 12 month period from August 2015 to July 2016 -- consisting of nearly 13,000 articles and close to 7.4 million words -- to examine what news discourse can tell us about gender imbalance. The corpus compiled by linguists at Lancaster University’s Corpus Approaches to Social Science Research Centre showed that the ratio of 'he' to 'she' in Australian news reporting is 3.4 to 1.

In any large set of text, the most frequent words are always the smallest - words such as 'the', 'and', 'a', etc... However, not very far down this list is the male pronoun: 'he'. In fact, 'he' was the 16th most frequently used word. By comparison, the female counterpart 'she' was number 66 on the list.



**==&gt; INSERT: Where are all the women?**



Grammatically, 'he' or 'she' in a text implies that you are the subject of the clause. Furthermore, in news conventions, it means the subject has lasted long enough in a story to graduate from a proper noun to a pronoun.

Proper nouns are also a good indicator of gender balance. It takes 20 names in the corpus before we reach a female name \(Julie Bishop was Australia's foreign minster during the period\).



**==&gt; INSERT: Top 21 names...**



I tweeted Dr Annabelle Lukin and she revealed that she used a simple concordancing program to produce this insightful public research.
