This session we'll cover four main areas.

 
###1. Context 

What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)? What is it look for and what are the applications for research?

###2. Background

What is the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)? How is it related to NLP and why might I use it?

###3. Examples

How is NLTK used in research? Let's explore some examples from a diverse arrange of disciplines. 

###4. Activity

We'll play with some simple commands and syntax for exploring vocabulary; specifically, concordancing and collocational analysis.

###5. Help!
Resources to help you on your nltk journey
