# Natural Language Processing with NLTK

<br>
Welcome to this session on textual analysis with the Natural Language Toolkit or nltk, as we'll call it from now on. Nltk uses the computer programming language Python for natural language processing.

This session we'll cover four main areas.

 
###1) Background:

What is nltk and what is it good for

###2) Context:
What are the applications of Natural Language Processing for research, examples and possibilities

###3) Activity:

We'll play with some simple commands and syntax for exploring vocabulary; specifically, concordancing and collocational analysis.

###4) Help!
Resources to help you on your nltk journey
