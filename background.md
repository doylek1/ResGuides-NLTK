# Background

Let's start with some definitions...

##Natural Languages:
You are very familiar with these. You speak at least one, maybe more. We use the slightly strange term natural language to distinguish from computer languages. 

Examples of natural languages include: Mandarin, English, Portuguese, Arabic -- and I bet you can name a bunch more. 

These languages have history and culture. They are beautiful and messy. That's why we fall in love with them. Consequently, they are full of ambiguity and mystery. Words have multiple meanings.  


In contrast, **artificial languages**, for example Python, have no such ambiguity. Ambiguity in computer programming languages leads to error messages. Computer languages are mathematical and logical.

**Natural Language Processing** (NLP) tries to use programming to understand human languages.
