# Background

Let's start with some definitions...

##Natural Languages:
You are very familiar with these. You speak at least one, maybe more. We use the slightly strange term natural language to distinguish from computer languages. 

Some examples of natural languages include; Mandarin, English, Portuguese, Arabic -- and I bet you can name a bunch more. 

These languages have history and culture. They are beautiful and messy. That's why we fall in love with them. Languages are full of ambiguity and mystery and words have multiple meanings.  


In contrast, **artificial languages**, for example Python, have no such ambiguity. Computer languages are mathematical and logical. Ambiguity in computer programming languages leads to error messages. 

!!--Enter a picture of just such an error message--!!

**Natural Language Processing** (NLP) tries to use programming to understand human languages. Usually, this is in the form of written text or audio that is translated into text and then converting language into something the computer can understand. Numbers.  

I am using NLP in a broad sense here... i.e. any computer manipulation of natural language. 

At one extreme, this could be simple. For example, counting word frequencies to compare different writing styles. 

At the other extreme, you can get very complicated very quickly. For example, "understanding" complete human utterances to the extend you can respond to them.
