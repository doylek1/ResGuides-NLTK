###It's the ideas, stupid

To adapt a phrase from the successful 1992 Clinton presidential campaign, "it's the ideas, stupid"... 

In this chapter we have explored the diverse range of interdisciplinary research that uses NLP to answer innovative new research questions, using just a few features of NLTK (e.g. WordNet, tokenization, concordancing and collocations etc...). As well as more complicated programs, such as Maholw or complicated like the Naive Bayes classier)
- Automate the repetitive tasks and focus on analysis your research
- Play and have fun. This is how you learn code. Don't try to master or even understand every at once. 
- Surround yourself with the people who can help you. Join a community
- The trick is to learn how to think computationally. This is not a computer science think. depending on your discpline this will be more or no at all familiar. The trick is to apply computational thinking (define) to traditional social science questions (give examples and think of computational solutions). Basically, this is the practices of translation between one humanistic sense-making tradition (situational awareness etc...) and modelling etc... (get from literature you're reading atm)
