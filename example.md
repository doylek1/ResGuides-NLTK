> Using Twitter Data to Gain Insights into E-cigarette Marketing and Locations of Use: An Infoveillance Study (Kim et al. 2015)

This research, published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research, investigates the marketing of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) via social media through a linguistic analysis of Twitter data. 

Marketing and use of electronic cigarettes have increased exponentially in recent years. This trend is in part fueled by marketing and word-of-mouth communication on social media platforms like Twitter.

This study examines Twitter posts about e-cigarettes between the years 2008-2013 to gain insights into marketing trends in promoting and selling e-cigarettes and the locations where people use these devices.

Interestingly, the study uses a combination of manual classification and natural language processing to extract prepositional phrases, such as 'in', 'at' or 'of', to determine the locations where people use, or observe others using, e-cigarettes.

To prepare the corpus to extract these phrases, they use the NLTK parts-of-speech tagger to label each word in a tweet with its part of speech. 

The authors confirmed an exponential increase in the volume of twitters on the subject of e-cigarettes, which is consistent with increase expenditure on e-cigarette marketing and use among youths and adults. They also found that the vast majority of tweets (93.43%) were advertising the devices, as opposed to only 6.57% classed as non-advertisements. *"The ease of posting user-generated content online and sharing this information across social media platforms such as Twitter suggests that Twitter users may be exposed to more e-cigarette brands and online vendors than non-Twitter users"*.

*"Interestingly, we find posts about e-cigarettes being used in public spaces, with class being the top mention. Although some of these tweets indicate that students (and staff in some cases) were using e-cigarettes in class, the majority of tweets were from nonusers who expressed surprise or disdain at seeing others using e-cigarettes in public and were confused as to whether this is allowed. We do not know from the tweets whether these were youth or young adults tweeting about a high school class or a college class, and future studies should examine ways to determine the demographics of tweeters. Regardless, these results suggest that youth and young adults may be exposed to e-cigarette use in their everyday lives, and the lack of action by staff may give them a sense that e-cigarette use is permissible and not as harmful as cigarettes. This is a concern among public health professionals and increasingly local governments have introduced [ 52] and passed [ 53] policies banning the use of e-cigarettes in public places and in schools"*
