> Using Twitter Data to Gain Insights into E-cigarette Marketing and Locations of Use: An Infoveillance Study (Kim et al. 2015)

Marketing and use of electronic cigarettes have increased exponentially in recent years. This trend is in part fueled by marketing and word-of-mouth communication on social media platforms, such as Twitter.

This study examines Twitter posts about e-cigarettes between 2008 and 2013 to gain insights into marketing trends in promoting and selling e-cigarettes and the locations where people use these devices.

Interestingly, the study uses a combination of manual classification and natural language processing...

*"By using a combination of natural language processing and manual classification, we extracted prepositional phrases indicating where people used e-cigarettes or observed others using them"*

To prepare the corpus to extract these phrases, they*"ran each cleaned tweet through the parts-of-speech tagger in the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library. The tagger attempted to label each word in a document (ie, tweet) with its part of speech"*
